sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?:

After sort2 was defined, doing a second experiment applying only sorts 1 and 3 to a sorted line of
values (sorted10000.txt), sort1 was the fastest one to provide the result. Since the omega notation
of a bubble sort's running time is considerably lower than the one of selection sort, is correct
to say that sort1 represents bubble sort.

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?:

When first comparing all the algorithms using the same shuffled line of values (random100000.txt),
sort2 operated with the least amount of time therefore being the most efficient one.

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?:

Sort3 had the highest running time among all 3 algorithms on both experiments.
